## Sihala Handwriting Recognition

> add Discription here asap

The project goals are to achieve real time **Sinhala** handwriting based on given templates. The perspective of the project is letter recognition via NLP not CV. 

Initial attempts are  

  1. **DTW**: Dynamic Time Warping
  2. Via Time series similarity
    i. correlation
      i. pearson
      ii. **distance correlation**
    ii. based on cepstral coefficient
  3. Wavelet methods
    a. Bi-wavelet similarity
    b. **Wavelet coherence**
  4. *Angle measuring method*
